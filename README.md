# Compiler-Course-Projects-S2024
Introduction to Compiler and Programming Languages Design course projects in the spring semester of the University of Tehran under the supervision of Dr.Tavassoli.

- ## [Phase-1](https://github.com/MobinaMhr/Compiler-Course-Projects-S2024/tree/main/Phase-1). Lexical and Syntax Analysis

In this phase, we utilized ANTLR4 to perform lexical and syntax analysis for the FunctionCraft language. The result of this process is a parse tree representing the input program.

- ## [Phase-2](https://github.com/MobinaMhr/Compiler-Course-Projects-S2024/tree/main/Phase-2). Name Analysis

In this phase, we generated the abstract syntax tree (AST) from the input program and conducted name analysis for the FunctionCraft language. The outcome of this phase includes any compile-time errors associated with the name analysis.

- ## [Phase-3](https://github.com/MobinaMhr/Compiler-Course-Projects-S2024/tree/main/Phase-3). Type Analysis

In this phase, we conducted type analysis for the FunctionCraft language. This phase produces compile-time errors related to type analysis.

- ## [Phase-4](https://github.com/MobinaMhr/Compiler-Course-Projects-S2024/tree/main/Phase-4). Code Generation

In this phase, we employed the Jasmin library to generate Java bytecode for the FunctionCraft language. The output of this phase is Java bytecode for the input program, which can be executed on the JVM.
